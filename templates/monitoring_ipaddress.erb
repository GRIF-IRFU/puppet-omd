<%# Goal of this template is to find out which interface should be exported to the OMD server.
It can indeed happen that when you're on a multi-network host (openstack host for instance), you have multiple ip addresses.
And the ::ipaddress fact is then sort of useles as it seems it's taking the ip address of the first interface it finds

In order for it to work, you must pass your network address as a param (e.g : 192.168.1.0) to the calling defined resource.
You cannot use hiera for defined resources.

In case there are multiplie interfaces using the same network (why ?), we make sure there's only one interface output by separating the loop from the output -%>
<% if @monitoring_network -%>
  <%- iface_ip='' -%>
  <%- @interfaces.split(',').each do |iface| -%>
    <%- iface_net = 'network_' + iface -%>
    <%- iface_ipvar = 'ipaddress_' + iface -%>
    <%- if scope[ iface_net ] == @monitoring_network -%>
      <%- iface_ip = scope[iface_ipvar] -%>
    <%- end -%>
  <%- end -%>
<% end -%>
<%= iface_ip -%>
